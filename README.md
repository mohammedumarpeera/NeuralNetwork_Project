# NeuralNetwork_Project
Neural Network model to recognize handwritten digits.

Given a trained dataset as well a test dataset (without labels) the following project implements a Neural Network model to help recognize handwritten digits as well to determine the classification accuracy given a trained dataset and a test dataset. 
The model is coded in Python making use of the Keras visualizer module. 

The second part of the project involved fine tuning the model to implement a deep network making use of the TensorFlow framework. 

The project includes the .ipynb file with the network visualized as well classification accuracy's mentioned. 
Also included are drawn out neural network models for both the Questions within the project which helps to visualize the model.
